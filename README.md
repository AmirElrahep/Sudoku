## General info

This is a modern implementation of the classic game Sudoku. Unlike most Sudoku games, this is stress free as there is no
pressure to finish the puzzle quickly and there is no scoring system. The current puzzle is never saved, so the user can
quit and play again without the limitation of finishing a puzzle before moving on.

Motivation behind the project was to make an elegant looking desktop application of the game Sudoku that provided a
stress free paying environment.

### Built With

* JavaFX
* JFoenix
* Maven
